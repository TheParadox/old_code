# Various Old coding projects
Various coding projects over the years. Would have uploaded school coding projects, however the laptop harddrive is encrypted AND 
corrupted and have not been able to recover thus far.

There is a major project that I have been working on, that is not on GitHub - its on a privately hosted GitBucket server.
It is a game - I am creating the game engine for it, using libraries for the parts I can; learning and coding the rest.

Looking back I can see a few places I would make changes to these old projects, but that would be another time...

##Notes about the code:
I have not made any changes, added, removed comments, tested to make sure they still build and with what versions. If there is an
executable, they should still run. Although some have been built for Linux and others Windows.

The projects are not in order of creation.

## C Tutoring Code:
I worked as a Teaching Assistant at UCCS for a semester. This was one of the end projects, I created it to have a simple working example
to show students asking for assistance, yet still following the assignment guidelines. 

## C++ Personal:
This is an early attempt for my game at trying to get windowing and UI working. 
Its very simple, basic and very much a prototype/learning project.

## C++ Personal 2:
This is an older 'module' for my game - yes it is in space thus galaxy creation. I have newer versions with some revisions.
Some of the math is trial and error (visualized VIA HTML/PHP) - the rest is based on NASA data.

## PAH_Inventory:
Is a program I wrote in a couple hours for my current contract. We had multiple sets of device names, from walkthroughs, inventory lists
and a deployed list. As there were quite a few discrepencies. As Excel was not able to easily do what we want I created this to handle the 
CSV files. This loads a CSV file (name given via command line arguement) loads, sorts and removes devices that are found in all of the
columns. It exports the result in a CSV file.

Looking back - the better option/solution would have been to create an SQL database, importing the files and then running SQL
queries to filter and find what we needed.

##Python Robotics:
For a Master's Degree course in robotics. This is part of a group project, of which mine was trying to get the Machine Learning Pathfinding
to work. We used it in Coppelia Sim.

## School Planner:
This was an idea I had, after teaching a year of Highschool - for an offline program that could assist with tracking grades, materials,
quizzes, etc... It also stemmed from a family I know whom homeschools and was looking for an easier offline method of keeping track.
Unfortunately, never got the ball rolling due to the stakeholders not knowing what they actually wanted or needed - and I was no longer 
teaching, thus wasn't a priority for me.

Uses: Ultralight - The core application with web-based UI
SQLite: for the database
MSVC: Using MS Visual Studio Code, just to help me keep track as I originally started the project with Visual Studio. And wanted a
easy way of keeping track of the two.

This project was before and one of the reasons I finally created my own private GitLab server for my projects.
